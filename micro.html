       	<h2>Microprocessor Technology</h2><br>
       	<p>Microprocessor, any of a type of miniature electronic device that contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry necessary to perform the functions of a digital computer’s central<br> processing unit. In effect, this kind of integrated circuit can interpret and execute program instructions as well as handle arithmetic operations.<br>

In the early 1970s the introduction of large-scale integration (LSI)—which made it possible to pack thousands of transistors, diodes, and resistors onto a silicon chip less than 0.2 inch <br>(5 mm) square—led to the development of the microprocessor. The first microprocessor was the Intel 4004, which was introduced in 1971. During the early 1980s very large-scale<br> integration (VLSI) vastly increased the circuit density<br> of microprocessors. In the 2010s a single VLSI circuit holds billions of electronic components on a chip identical in size to the LSI circuit.<br>
<h2>What is a Microprocessor?</h2><br>

The microprocessor is the central unit of a computer system that performs arithmetic and logic operations, which generally include adding, subtracting, transferring numbers from one area<br> to another, and comparing two numbers. It's often known simply as a processor, a central processing unit, or as a logic chip. It's essentially the engine or the brain of the computer that goes<br> into motion when the computer is switched on. It's a programmable, multipurpose device that incorporates the functions of a CPU (central processing unit) on a single IC (integrated circuit).<br>

<h2>How Does a Microprocessor Work?</h2><br>
A microprocessor accepts binary data as input, processes that data, and then provides output based on the instructions stored in the memory. The data is processed using the microprocessor's <br>ALU (arithmetical and logical unit), control unit, and a register array. The register array processes the data via a number of registers that act as temporary fast access memory locations.<br> The flow of instructions and data through the system is managed by the control unit.<br>

<h2>Benefits of a Microprocessor</h2><br>
But computer systems aren't the only devices that use microprocessors. Everything from smartphones to household appliances to cars use microprocessors these days. Here are a few reasons why<br> microprocessors are so widely used:<br>

<li>They don't cost a lot - Due to their use of IC technology, microprocessors don't cost much to produce. This means that the use of microprocessors can greatly reduce <br>the cost of the system it's used in.<br>

<li>They are fast - The technology used to produce modern microprocessors has allowed them to operate at incredibly high speeds--today's microprocessors can execute millions<br> of instructions per second.<br>

<li>They consume little power - Power consumption is much lower than other types of processors since microprocessors are manufactured using metal oxide semiconductor technology. <br>This makes devices equipped with microprocessors much more energy efficient.<br>

<li>They are portable - Due to how small microprocessors are and that they don't consume a lot of power, devices using microprocessors can be designed to be portable (like smartphones).<br>

<li>They are reliable - Because semiconductor technology is used in the production of microprocessors, their failure rate is extremely low.</li><br><br></rb>

	<h2>Vacuum Tube</h2><br>
	The vacuum tube is a device that was developed by English physicist John Ambrose Fleming for the first time in 1904, which contains electrodes to control electron flow. Generally, <br>in a sealed container, it is used to control flow with the help of a vacuum. In early computers, it was also used as a switch or an amplifier, and it is also known as a valve or an electron tube. <br><br>

		A vacuum tube or electron tube contains two or more electrodes that are separated through ionized gas or vacuum at low pressure. Through the tube from one electrode to another,<br> its operation is depending on the basis of the generation and transfer of electrons.<br><br>

   <h2>Evolution of Sensors</h2><br><br>
    
      As human beings started using technology for a better living, came the need for sensing and sensory devices. Sensors brought about a change in the way things are perceived and provided a definitive way forward in the dream of making comfortable living affordable for human beings. The evolution of sensors leading to the emergence of smart objects that are an integral part of the cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been discussed in this paper. The various challenges that exist in the field of security of the IoT devices and the ways of handling them are outlined. An attempt has been made to discuss the concept of botnets and the various ways in which attackers exploit these especially in the IoT devices and the possible outcomes.

			<h2>ARMS</h2><br>
			<h3>What Does Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) Mean?</h3><br>
Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) is a processor architecture based on a 32-bit reduced instruction set (RISC) computer. Licensed worldwide, the ARM architecture is the most commonly implemented 32-bit instruction set architecture. ARM architecture is implemented on Windows, Unix, and Unix-like operating systems, including Apple iOS, Android, BSD, Inferno, Solaris, WebOS, Plan 9 and GNU/Linux.<br>

Advanced RISC Machine was originally known as Acorn RISC Machine.
